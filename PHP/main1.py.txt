    - Strength, which you will use in combat or any strength test
    - Dexterity, which you will use in any ability test
    - Magic, which you will use whenever you need to cast a spell or use/inspect a magical item or place
    - Life, which determines your life energy, points will be lost when hurt, 
      and whenever Life reaches 0, your character dies.
